# Admin-Access

This Python script verifies whether the entered username matches a predefined **admin username** stored in the system. If it matches, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.

## 🔒 Purpose

To demonstrate a simple access control mechanism using basic string comparison in Python.

## 🧠 How It Works

- A predefined admin username is stored in the script.
- The user is prompted to input a username and password.
- If the input matches the admin name (case-sensitive), access is granted.
- Otherwise, access is denied.
